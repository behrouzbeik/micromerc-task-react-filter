# Create a filter component

Create a filter component that only display users whose names contain the value you specified.
If the filter is empty, show all users.

For users, you have a dummy data set in "./src/data/users.json".

## Requirements

- html input for filter value (case insensitive).
- render filtered user names to the DOM.
- extract filter logic to a custom hook.
- implement a debounce.

## Info

- html attribute "role" should not be removed. Is required for testing.
- see if your code works in the "Tests" tab.

## Preview
